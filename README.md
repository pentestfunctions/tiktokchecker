### TikTok Video Info Extractor

#### Description:
This is a Tampermonkey userscript designed to extract video information from TikTok user profiles. When executed on a TikTok user's profile, it creates a button named "Extract Video Info". Clicking this button generates a table containing the Titles, Views, and Hashtags of the user's videos and sorts them based on the number of views. The script also provides a section above the table displaying a count of the most used hashtags that are used more than once, allowing users to quickly see which hashtags are prevalent.

#### Features:
- Extracts and displays video Titles, Views, and Hashtags in a sortable table.
- Provides a quick overview of the most used hashtags.
- Allows sorting of the videos based on view counts in ascending and descending order with a single click on the Views header.
- Displays a count of the most used hashtags above the table.

#### Usage:
1. Navigate to a TikTok user's profile.
2. Make sure you scroll to the bottom of the users videos to load them all.
3. Click the "Extract Video Info" button.
4. View the sorted table and the list of most used hashtags.

#### Future Enhancements:
1. **Analyze Hashtags for Performance:**
   - Develop functionality to analyze hashtags based on view counts, enabling users to discern which hashtags are associated with higher views and engagement.

2. **Enhanced Hashtag Display:**
   - Modify the user interface to showcase hashtags in a separate area or dropdown menu box, providing a more organized and user-friendly display.
